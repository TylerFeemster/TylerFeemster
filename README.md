ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TylerFeemster. On Kaggle, I'm [tylerfeemster](https://www.kaggle.com/tylerfeemster).

**I'm currently open to opportunities in the Unites States, particularly in Tucson.**

ðŸ‘€ Interested in deep learning architectures, particularly Geometric Deep Learning (GDL).
As both decision trees and mutual information are invariant to monotonic transformations of features,
I'm applying the insights of GDL to tabular data via decision trees and information theory.
