👋 Hi, I’m @TylerFeemster. On Kaggle, I'm [tylerfeemster](https://www.kaggle.com/tylerfeemster).

**I'm currently open to data opportunities in the Unites States, particularly in Arizona.**

👀 Interested in deep learning architectures, particularly Geometric Deep Learning (GDL).
As both decision trees and mutual information are invariant to monotonic transformations of features,
I'm looking to apply the insights of GDL to tabular data via decision trees and information theory.

🌱 Currently playing with Google's GenAI SDK for Python.

💞️ Always open to teaming up on Kaggle Competitions. *For real, hit me up!* On the development
side, I'm looking to collaborate on building feature insight tools to aid in feature engineering.

📫 Message me via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tylerfeemster).
