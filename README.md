👋 Hi, I’m @TylerFeemster. On Kaggle, I'm [tylerfeemster](https://www.kaggle.com/tylerfeemster).

**I'm currently open to opportunities in the Unites States, particularly in Tucson.**

👀 Interested in deep learning architectures, particularly Geometric Deep Learning (GDL).
As both decision trees and mutual information are invariant to monotonic transformations of features,
I'm applying the insights of GDL to tabular data via decision trees and information theory.

💞️ Always open to teaming up on Kaggle Competitions. *For real, hit me up!* On the development
side, I'm looking to collaborate on building feature insight tools to aid in feature engineering.

📫 Message me via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tylerfeemster).
